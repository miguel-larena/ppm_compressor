=== Architecture ===
a) 40image.c - Main function that invokes the appropriate compress and 
               decompress functions

b) compress40.c - Drives logic for compress and decompress functions, and 
                  invokes the relevant helper functions

c) compressions.c - Contains definitions for all compression helper functions.
    
d) decompressions.c - Contains definitions for all decompression helper 
                      functions.

e) bitpack.c - Defines helper functions for bitpacking and unpacking codewords.
    
    
=== Notes ===

We have correctly implemented compress40.c, compressions.c, decompressions.c,
and bitpack.c to compile and run with no errors or leaks. For incorrectly
formatted files, decopressions.c will raise a C.R.E.

=== Hours Spent ===
About 15 hours were spent analyzing the problems for the assignment and
about another 35 hours solving the problems.
